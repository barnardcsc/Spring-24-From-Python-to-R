# Spring-24-From-Python-to-R

This workshop is taught by Dan Woulfin, Ph.D., M.L.S., Computational Research Instruction Librarian at Columbia Libraries.
Dan Woulfin is currently the Computational Research Instruction librarian at Columbia University Libraries. Prior to this position he was the Senior Data Associate at Global TIES for Children, an international social science research center at NYU. There he worked daily in R which he used to curate, clean, wrangle and engineer research data throughout the research data lifecycle and to prepare for archiving. He is also a coauthor of 'rddi', an R package on CRAN, and an accompanying shiny application, 'diyddi'. 


This workshop explores the basics of the R programming language from a Python user's perspective, paying particular attention to some of the structural, as well as syntactic and idiomatic differences between the two languages. We look at R's strengths and weaknesses with the goal of exposing non-R users to the language using practical hands-on exercises. Suitable for beginning/novice programmers but based on the practicalities of working with real-world data.
